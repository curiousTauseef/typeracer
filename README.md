typeracer.js
============

ez way to rek others in da typeracer scrubz


## instructions

inject `typeracer.js` or `typeracerSpace.js` once race has started


## why this?

it improves upon other methods by using event codes to act like a human

i also included `spaceTyperacer.js` which will autofill the word. if you click the input field (`.txtInput`) and hold your keyboard's space key, you will do very, very well :laughing: ... __this method seems to consistently perform better at avoiding being caught by the system since it uses events emitted from your keyboard rather than jQuery's *nearly* undocumented `which` argument.__


## warning

that said, be careful. do it too many times and the captcha test comes up, which gets hard w/ the speed requirements! also, you may get disqualified lol (warning: gets fun quickly)
